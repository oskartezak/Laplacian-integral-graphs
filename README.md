# Laplacian-integral-graphs

We say that a graph is Laplacian integral if all its Laplacian eigenvalues are integers. We try to find as many as possible unicyclic and bicyclic graphs for which the Laplacian eigenvalues are integers. We apply an exhaustive search for graphs of small order, and apply some stochastic search for larger orders. We are trying to find a pattern/method for constructing Laplacian integral graphs or at least find graphs with as many integer eingenvalues as possible.

Basic testing can be found in unicyclic.ipynb and bicyclic.ipynb under section code. In unicyclic_stohastic.ipynb and bicyclic_stohastic.ipynb you can find searching for Laplacian integral graphs randomly, which is more or less very optimistic shot in the dark. We try to prove the shape of searched graphs in shape_hypotesis.ipynb and finally we apply search for graphs with as many integer eingenvalues as possible in integer_eingenvalues.ipynb.
